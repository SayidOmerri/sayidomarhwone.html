    <h1>SOMALI HISTORY</h1>
    <p> Somalia was likely one of the first lands to be settled by early humans due to its location.<br>
        Hunter-gatherers who would later migrate out of Africa likely settled here before their migrations. <br>
        During the Stone Age, the Doian and Hargeisan cultures flourished here.  <br>
        The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somalia dating back to the 4th millennium BCE. <br>
        The stone implements from the Jalelo site in the north were also characterized in 1909,  <br>
        as important artifacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the Paleolithic between the East and the West. <br>
        According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithicperiod  <br>
        from the family's proposed urheimat ("original homeland") in the Nile Valley, or the Near East. <br>
        The Laas Geel complex on the outskirts of Hargeisa in northwestern Somalia dates back approximately 5,000 years, <br>
        and has rock art depicting both wild animals and decorated cows. <br>
        Other cave paintings are found in the northern Dhambalin region, which feature one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. <br>
        The rock art is dated to 1,000 to 3,000 BCE. Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in northern Somalia liesKarinhegane,  <br> 
        the site of numerous cave paintings, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old.</p>
